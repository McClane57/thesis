\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:mor-conclusion}
{In this work, we propose a randomized proximal gradient method harnessing the underlying structure. We introduce two key components: i) a random subspace proximal gradient algorithm; ii) an identification-based sampling of the subspaces. Their interplay brings a significant performance improvement on typical learning problems in terms of dimensions explored.
